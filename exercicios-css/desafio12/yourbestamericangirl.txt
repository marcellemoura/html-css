Your Best American Girl

If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me.

//---

You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

//---

Don't wait for me, I can't come.

Your mother wouldn't approve
Of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying
To be your best American girl

//---

You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this.

//---

Your mother wouldn't approve
Of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying
To be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve
Of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think do
